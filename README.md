This is a script for the web-browser game HaremHeroes found on Nutaku.net.
The two main features of the script are:
1. To randomize the girl shown on the home screen. (and many other places like the shop, energy popups, etc!)
2. Allow you to cycle through all a girls images with the scroll wheel. (works most places you see a girl)

To use it, you will need to install the Tampermonkey addon for chrome, which is a handy extension that allows you to run custom javascript on any website you want.

To install WaifuRandomizer:
1. open the Tampermonkey dashboard (from the little black icon at the top right of chrome)
2. open "installed userscripts" tab if it isnt open already
3. and drag and drop the script into the browser.

Next time you refresh the game, your waifus will be randomized!

There are some settings at the top of the script if you want to customize your experience further. The default settings provide the intended experience.

If you have any suggestions or find any bugs (there are several, this was a personal project that I decided I ought to share, and I am not a js guru) feel free to let me know. If enough people show interest in it, I may increase functionality. 

Please share with your friends and club!

Lastly, if you get enjoyment out of this little script and want to throw a few bucks my way, I set up a patreon here: patreon.com/ADGenerit
